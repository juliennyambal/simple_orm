## 1. Setting Up Your Environment

First, we'll create a virtual environment to manage our project's dependencies. This keeps your project isolated and avoids conflicts with other Python packages.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'env'
python -m venv orm_venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
orm_venv\Scripts\activate
# On MacOS/Linux
source orm_venv/bin/activate
```

## 2. Installing SQLAlchemy 2.0

With your virtual environment active, install SQLAlchemy 2.0. This version includes several enhancements over previous versions.

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
```

or to be more specific:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy==2.0.*
```
The current code is built on the basis of SQLAlchemy 2.0. It may fail when using SQLAlchemy 1.x. 

## 3. Creating the ORM Script

Create a new Python file named `orm_script.py` where we will write our ORM code.

In your linux system, including MacOs:
```bash
touch orm_script.py
```
or create this file on Windows.

In this file, we'll include all the code necessary to set up and use our ORM.

## 4. Setting Up the SQLAlchemy Engine

The engine is the core of SQLAlchemy's connection to your database. It manages the connections and interactions with the database backend. 

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Example using SQLite
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db', echo=True)

# Example using PostgreSQL
# engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase')

# Example using MySQL
# engine = create_engine('mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase')

# Example using Oracle
# engine = create_engine('oracle+cx_oracle://user:password@localhost/mydatabase')
```

The `echo=True` parameter will output the generated SQL queries to the console, which is useful for debugging.

## 5. Establishing a Session

The session is the interface to the database. It allows you to query, add, update, and delete objects from the database.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

# Create a Session instance
session = Session()
```

## 6. Defining the Base Class

The base class is the foundation for all our ORM-mapped classes. It provides the framework for table and class definitions.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base

# Create a base class for our classes to inherit
Base = declarative_base()
```

## 7. Creating ORM Mapped Classes

Define your database models by creating classes that inherit from the `Base` class. Each class represents a table in your database.

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import mapped_column, Mapped, relationship
from sqlalchemy import Integer, String

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user_table"

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    name: Mapped[str]  = mapped_column(String(30))
    age: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer)

    comment: Mapped["Comment"] = relationship(back_populates="user")
    profile: Mapped["Profile"] = relationship(back_populates="user")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<User(name={self.name}, age={self.age})>"
```

### Explanation of User Model Attributes and Relationships

The `User` class defines the structure of a user record in your database. Let's break down the key aspects:

**Table and Columns:**

- `__tablename__ = "user_table"`: This specifies the name of the table that will be created in your database to store user information.

- **Basic User Attributes:**

    - `id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)`: This defines the `id` column for each user. It's an integer (`int`) and is set as the primary key (`primary_key=True`), ensuring each user has a unique identifier.
    - `name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(30))`: This defines the `name` column, storing the user's name as a string (`str`) with a maximum length of 30 characters (`String(30)`).
    - `age: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(Integer)`: This defines the `age` column, storing the user's age as an integer (`int`).

**Relationships: `comment` and `profile`**

These columns are particularly interesting as they represent relationships between the `User` model and other models in your database. Let's delve deeper:

- `comment: Mapped["Comment"] = relationship(back_populates="user")`:
    - This defines a one-to-many relationship between a `User` and their associated `Comment` objects. It means one user can have multiple comments.
    - `Mapped["Comment"]`: This specifies that the `comment` attribute will hold references to `Comment` objects.
    - `relationship(back_populates="user")`: This creates a bidirectional relationship. When accessing a user's `comment` attribute, you'll retrieve their comments. Conversely, within the `Comment` model, there's likely a `user` attribute that references the user who wrote the comment (using `back_populates="user"`).

- `profile: Mapped["Profile"] = relationship(back_populates="user")`:
    - This defines a one-to-one relationship between a `User` and their `Profile` information. Each user has a single profile.
    - `Mapped["Profile"]`: Similar to `comment`, this indicates the `profile` attribute will hold a reference to a `Profile` object.
    - `relationship(back_populates="user")`: Again, this establishes a bidirectional relationship. Accessing a user's `profile` attribute retrieves their profile information, and the `Profile` model likely has a `user` attribute referencing the associated user (using `back_populates="user"`).

By defining these relationships, you're telling SQLAlchemy how to manage the connections between users, comments, and profiles in your database. This allows you to easily retrieve related data in a single query.


Then you have: 

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import mapped_column, Mapped, relationship
from sqlalchemy import Integer, String, ForeignKey

class Profile(Base):
    __tablename__ = "profile_table"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    profile: Mapped[str]  = mapped_column(String(30))
    user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("user_table.id"))
    user: Mapped['User'] = relationship("User", back_populates="profile")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.profile}"
    

class Comment(Base):
    __tablename__ = "comment_table"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    comment: Mapped[str]  = mapped_column(String(30))
    user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("user_table.id"))
    user: Mapped['User'] = relationship(back_populates="comment")

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.comment}"
```

### Explanation of Profile and Comment Models

**Profile Model:**

The `Profile` class defines the structure for storing user profile information in your database.

- **Table and Column:**

    - `__tablename__ = "profile_table"`: This specifies the table name in the database to store profile data.

- **Profile Information:**

    - `id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)`: The `id` column acts as the primary key, uniquely identifying each profile record.
    - `profile: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(30))`: This column stores the user's profile information as a string (`str`), with a maximum length of 30 characters (`String(30)`).

- **Foreign Key Relationship:**

    - `user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("user_table.id"))`: This creates a foreign key constraint. It ensures the `user_id` in the `Profile` table references a valid `id` in the `user_table`. This establishes a one-to-one relationship between a `User` and their `Profile`.
    - In simpler terms, each profile belongs to exactly one user.

- **Relationship with User:**

    - `user: Mapped['User'] = relationship("User", back_populates="profile")`: This defines a bidirectional relationship with the `User` model.
        - `Mapped['User']`: The `user` attribute will hold a reference to a `User` object.
        - `relationship("User", back_populates="profile")`: Establishes a connection between `Profile` and `User`. When accessing a user's `profile` attribute, you'll retrieve their profile information. Conversely, the `User` model likely has a `profile` attribute referencing the associated profile (using `back_populates="profile"`).


**Comment Model:**

The `Comment` class defines the structure for storing user comments in your database.

- **Table and Column:**

    - `__tablename__ = "comment_table"`: This specifies the table name in the database to store user comments.

- **Comment Information:**

    - `id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)`: The `id` column acts as the primary key, uniquely identifying each comment record.
    - `comment: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(30))`: This column stores the user's comment as a string (`str`), with a maximum length of 30 characters (`String(30)`).

- **Foreign Key Relationship:**

    - `user_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("user_table.id"))`: Similar to the `Profile` model, this creates a foreign key constraint, ensuring the `user_id` in the `Comment` table references a valid `id` in the `user_table`. This establishes a one-to-many relationship between a `User` and their associated comments.
    - In simpler terms, one user can have multiple comments.

- **Relationship with User:**

    - `user: Mapped['User'] = relationship("User", back_populates="comment")`: This defines a bidirectional relationship with the `User` model.
        - `Mapped['User']`: The `user` attribute will hold a reference to a `User` object.
        - `relationship("User", back_populates="comment")`: Establishes a connection between `Comment` and `User`. When accessing a user's `comment` attribute, you'll retrieve their comments. Conversely, the `User` model likely has a `comment` attribute referencing the associated comments (using `back_populates="comment"`).

By defining these relationships, you're enabling SQLAlchemy to manage the connections between users, profiles, and comments effectively. You can efficiently retrieve related data in a single query, simplifying your database interactions.


## 8. Performing Database Operations

Create, query, update, and delete operations are done through the session. Here’s how you can perform basic CRUD operations:

### Create Tables

First, you need to create the tables in your database:

```python
# Create all tables in the engine (equivalent to "Create Table" in SQL)
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### Add New Records

To add a new user to the database:

```python
new_user = User(name='Alice', age=30)
session.add(new_user)
session.commit()
```

### Query Records

To query users from the database:

```python
# Query all users
users = session.execute(select(User)).all()
print(users)

# Query a user by name
alice = session.execute(select(User).where(User.name=="Alice")).first()
print(alice)
```

### Update Records

To update an existing user's information:

```python
alice = session.execute(select(User).where(User.name=="Alice")).scalar_one()
alice.age = 80
session.commit()
```

### Delete Records

To delete a user from the database:

```python
session.delete(alice)
session.commit()
```

## 9. Running Your ORM Script

Now that we have our ORM defined and can interact with our database, you can run your script:

```bash
python orm_script.py
```
